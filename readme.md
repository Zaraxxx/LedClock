# Project details 
This project is a fork of LedClock project from imeszaros (https://github.com/imeszaros/ledclock)

His code has been amended to fit the ShelfClock project that I built from DIY Machines (https://www.diymachines.co.uk/how-to-build-a-giant-hidden-shelf-edge-clock)


## Special thanks 

Many thanks to imeszaros (LedClock) and Luis (DIY machines) for the awesome work that they both did. I only combined the two projects.
